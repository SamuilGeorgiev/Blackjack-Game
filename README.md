# Simple Blackjack Game

This is a basic Blackjack game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players start with a set number of chips and try to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

## How to Play

1.  **Start Game:** Click the "START GAME" button to begin a new round. This will deal you two initial cards and display their sum.
2.  **Draw New Card:** If your current sum is 20 or less, you can click the "NEW CARD" button to draw an additional card.
3.  **Blackjack:** If your initial two cards sum up to exactly 21, you have Blackjack!
4.  **Bust:** If your hand's sum exceeds 21, you are "out of the game."

## Files Included

* **`index.html`**: The HTML file that structures the webpage, including the title, messages, card display, sum display, and buttons. It also links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
* **`index.css`**: The CSS file that styles the appearance of the webpage, including fonts, colors, background image, and button styles.
* **`index.js`**: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic, including dealing cards, calculating the sum, checking for Blackjack and busts, and updating the display.

## Setup

To play this game, you simply need to:

1.  Save the three files (`index.html`, `index.css`, `index.js`) in the same directory on your computer.
2.  Optionally, if you want the background image to work, create an `images` folder in the same directory and place an image named `table.png` inside it.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML**: For structuring the content of the webpage.
* **CSS**: For styling the visual presentation of the game.
* **JavaScript**: For implementing the game logic and making the game interactive.

## Potential Enhancements

This is a basic implementation and could be expanded with more features, such as:

* **Betting:** Allowing players to place bets before each round.
* **Dealer Logic:** Implementing a dealer with their own drawing rules.
* **Splitting and Doubling Down:** Adding more advanced Blackjack actions.
* **Visual Card Representation:** Displaying actual card images instead of just numbers.
* **Chip Management:** More robust tracking of player's winnings and losses.
* **Sound Effects:** Adding audio cues for game events.

Enjoy playing!
